Lawmakers are hopeful that this will accomplish a few key goals:\n\nFirst, prisoners will strive for good behavior overall, reducing the need for as much inmate health care, security, and other costs. Secondly, more prisoners will get out sooner, freeing up space for other criminals. Finally, and most importantly, released prisoners will be able to confidently readjust to society.\n\n\u201cWhat we see with ex-cons is that they can\u2019t get a good enough job to save for retirement, and they start getting hopeless when they realize that.

Zimmerman confronted Martin and wound up shooting and killing the unarmed teen. After an extremely high-profile case, which was racially delicate, Zimmerman was found not guilty.\n\nAccording to Lake Mary Police Department spokesperson Rochelle McCaffrey, Valenzeula and Zimmerman had been fighting after Valenzeula allegedly walked in on Zimmerman and two other men taking part in activities of a sexual nature. The two men, unnamed in the case, immediately fled the residence, leaving Valenzeula and Zimmerman alone.

Of those two, one was a dud, while the other one wiped out a bridge near the Taedong River,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough North Korean forces have thus far been unsuccessful in their attempts to inflict damage anywhere near American soil, US military personnel never underestimates the significance of any perceived attack. \u201cWe take each and every threat against the United States seriously,\u201d said Hudsonberry, \u201cno matter how weak or inept they may seem.\u201d\n\nIn the Rogen and Franco film, the duo play tabloid show stars who land an interview with Kim Jong-un, and are recruited by the CIA to \u201ctake him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess he just doesn\u2019t have that big a sense of humor,\u201d said Hollywood insider and North Korean military expert Danny Nang. \u201cReports circulated last June that Kim Jong-un was extremely upset with the film\u2019s plot, but we never expected military retaliation.

His government goes to great lengths to display the country\u2019s military might, and what North Korea shows on the outside does not necessarily represent what takes place on the inside.

While various experts insist that prices will continue to drop, what they and most United States government officials aren\u2019t telling you is, indeed, quite frightening.\n\nAdam Sieminski, Chief Administrator of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), announced today that it is his educated opinion after years of experience as an expert energy resource consultant, that gas prices will begin to rise very rapidly after the New Year, and continue throughout all of 2015. Sieminski says that prices of regular unleaded gasoline could very well reach $7.00 per-gallon by springtime.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the current production level of crude oil, which is seemingly leading the average American to believe that gas prices will continue to fall.

I will no longer put police in danger, no 911 calls will be answered and no crimes investigated in these newly formed \u2018Police Free Zones/\u2019 They can loot and riot all they want in their own neighborhoods as long as the stay out of the good areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI applaud the Governor\u2019s decision,\u201d said Police Chief Thomas Jackson. \u201cWith the Brown ruling coming back and violence beginning already, we needed this ruling and we got it.

Anyone wishing to enter may at their own risk, people trying to leave a police free zone will be searched and questioned. This move will not only make it safer for officers to do their jobs, but save taxpayers money because 98% of lawsuits against the police come from these black neighborhoods.

Jones is currently suing his parents, Mary and Jon Jones, but for something that most would agree they had no control over.\n\nJones has been in court trying to get a settlement for over a month, and it appears his lawyer is making a good case for him.\n\nLate in September, Jones filed the lawsuit in a Durham court that blamed his parents for his very small penis. His defense is that it has caused him depression, anxiety, and problems finding a girlfriend or wife because of it. At age 10, David had a penis that was only 3 inches when erect, and he has confirmed that it has not grown since.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of this little boy\u2019s penis,\u201d said Jones in his court appearance. \u201cI am ashamed of it.

Their claim is that although they wish that they could have provided David with his desired penis size, like a lot of things David wanted growing up, this is just one more thing they had no control over.\n\nJones parents have admitted that this is an issue he has been upset about since he was a child, but they continued to tell him that it would grow as he got older.\n\n\u201cHe always wanted a bigger penis,\u201d said Jon Jones, 61. \u201cHe saw me in the shower once by accident when he was about 7, and I think it\u2019s given him emotional distress ever since.

Cult-like recruiting tactics have gone global, with reports of American citizens lending support, and even traveling overseas to pledge their allegiance to the anti-American group.\n\nYesterday in Houston at Dodson Lake Park, one such supporter who had decided to speak out in favor of the terrorist organization and against America was beaten unconscious by a US Army veteran.\n\nThe anti-American speaker, whose name has been withheld until a security check can be fully completed, insisted he was exercising his Constitutional freedom of speech rights when he began approaching strangers at the popular water park/playground and quoting from the pro-ISIS leaflets he was handing out.\n\nVietnam and Gulf War war veteran Jim McDaniels, 61, was spending the day with his wife and twin granddaughters when he noticed a man who he described as \u2018a little jumpy\u2019 walking up to everyone handing out leaflets. \u201cHe walked over to us, kind of pushed the thing in our face and said \u2018spread the word,\u2019 so I took it,\u201d explained McDaniels. \u201cThen he started to walk away.

I never swear, mind you. But it was so hateful it got under my skin.

In a statement provided by her attorney, Ms. Lewinksy said \u201cThe dress was used as evidence during Prosecutor Ken Starr\u2019s trial and was no longer in my possession.

This year, though, even with the advent of the internet and phone-filing systems, people who file early and folks who wait until the final deadline, are looking to have their refunds held back several months, with payouts not expected to happen until October of 2015.\n\nThe news of the major change was first broken by website National Report, who says that the Obama administration is purposely holding owed refunds to help save the government money. According to Report, the Federal Government returns around $350 billion dollars of what it has collected from taxes throughout the year, and withholding the payouts until October will allow the government to gain an additional $30 billion in interest and additional borrowing costs.\n\nThe change is not universal, though. The new rebate delay is only set to affect those who have filled under an individual status, meaning large corporations and businesses will still be eligible to receive any refunds owed almost immediately, while the rest of us wait.\n\n\u201cYour money is still coming, and we will not be holding back an extra cent,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cPulling back payments until the end of 2015 will help increase government earnings.

Either my lungs are gonna go from these cheap cigarettes I\u2019m forced to smoke, or my doctor at the free clinic says I\u2019ll get it for my depression.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what would help turn things around, Candi brightened a little. \u201cIf I had a car I think I\u2019d be happier, and if I was happier I\u2019d be much more motivated to look for work. I mean, we can afford to drop all these bombs, and feed people overseas, but we can\u2019t make sure our own citizens have transportation. That\u2019s seriously messed up,\u201d said Candi. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for anything fancy like a Subaru or nothing. Just something like a Jetta or a Neon, you know? Not too old, though.

We as a country have plenty of room to accept all people, and I am opening our borders and our metaphoric arms to them by offering asylum, jobs, and healthcare.

They should go to school on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, giving their brains time to take in what they have learned the day before. I believe no employer should be allowed to not hire you based on your appearance or make you keep tattoos or piercings covered up. There is not enough individuality in the U.S., this needs to be addressed.\u201d Depp added.\n\nWhen asked about his chances as being considered a legitimate presidential contender, Depp said that he hoped he would have a better chance than most.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the clowns we have had in office the past fourteen years? Over the past 40 years, even. They are nothing more than puppets. There is zero honesty in U.S. politics today, I intend to put it all out there. If the American people can\u2019t appreciate that, then the social decline will continue,\u201d Depp answered. \u201cI would have never considered putting myself through such a thing, but when you look at the list of contenders for 2016 it is a frightful observation. I am pretty sure that the American people don\u2019t even like any of them.\u201d\n\nIt is not the most far-fetched idea for a legendary actor to seek the presidency. Ronald Reagan made the jump after two succesful terms as the 33rd governor of California.

The beloved activity for many children, held annually on October 31st, was officially made a misdemeanor within town limits on Wednesday.\n\nTown mayor Bob Appel explained the decision to the press early Wednesday morning, saying that banning candy and Halloween from within the schools was \u2018not enough\u2019 to keep their children safe from \u2018mental harm.\u2019\n\n\u201cHalloween is a dangerous holiday, filled with Satan, Pagan rituals, and dirty, filthy mischievous acts,\u201d said Appel. \u201cFor many years, children of this town were allowed to participate in Halloween parties at school, but with those parties the ghosts, goblins, demons, and other evil spirits that all go against the Bible. The younger kids were frightened, and the older kids wanted to know all about Halloween, and its sinister, anti-Christian beginnings.\u201d\n\nThe town voted to ban Halloween parties from schools and other public establishments in 2005. This year, though, will mark the first time that trick-or-treating will be completely abolished within town limits.\n\n\u201cAnyone caught trick-or-treating, or any homes that try to give out candy, will be ticketed with solicitation charges, a misdemeanor,\u201d said Appel. \u201cFor entertainment, children should sit at home and study the Bible, or work on school projects. Halloween is an unholy night that I, personally, am glad to have had a hand in stopping in our little town.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hated that on Halloween, I almost felt obligated to give out candy, lest I be tricked with rolls of T.P in my trees,\u201d said Margaret Hamilton, a resident in Livermore. \u201cThis year I can finally relax in peace, with no little hooligans to bother me. I\u2019d rather just keep my children home than have them out there with others who could be expressing themselves dangerously through costume and satan worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s bulls\u2014,\u201d said Cassandra Peterson, mother of 3 boys in Livermore public schools. \u201cI love Halloween, and so do my boys. We all loved dressing up, watching scary movies, and going out for candy. Hell, we\u2019re not even Christian. I guess we\u2019ll head over a town or two and trick-or-treat there.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation put a $25 million bounty on bin Laden as \u2018America\u2019s Most Wanted\u2019 killer. On May 2, 2011, it had been believed that bin Laden was shot and killed inside his private residence in Abbottabad, Pakistan by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group in a covert operation ordered by United States President Barack Obama.\n\nSpokesperson Anaba did not reveal where bin Laden was being held currently, but insisted that \u2018swift action\u2019 would be taken, and the mastermind terrorist would be dealt with immediately.\n\n\u201cHe will be handled in a timely manner, as soon as it is declared that he can not or will not provide any useful information on the current state of terrorism,\u201d Anaba stated.\n\nMany Americans had been feeling that bin Laden may be alive after the so-called raid and shooting had taken place in 2011, and no photographic or video proof has surfaced to prove that he was, indeed, deceased. When asked whether there would be evidence to prove to the American people that this was indeed Osama bin Laden, Anaba told the press, \u201cI promise to you that we have Osama bin Laden in custody, this is strictly an operation of the United States government and it will be handled within our own walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we provide proof? Of course we can,\u201d continued Anaba. \u201cWe can always provide proof when we need to. Will we provide proof? It is not our job to decide. That will be up to President Obama and his administration. Until then, I can only confirm that Osama bin Laden is in the custody of the United States government and that he will be handled and dealt with a very swift manner of action.\u201d\n\nSpeculation of bin Laden\u2019s acquaintance to the terror group known as ISIS has been considered since it was discovered he was living in the United States, however Anaba denied to comment on the matter.\n\n\u201cI cannot confirm nor deny that we may or may not believe ISIS is connected with Osama bin Laden. This issue will not be addressed in a public manner at this time,\u201d Anaba added. \u201cTo be quite honest, you\u2019re all lucky we\u2019re even telling you that we found him in the first place.

Homeowners who want to show support for their party candidate or candidates often put signs in front of their own homes. Business owners often stupidly do the same, cutting off half of their clientele by openly displaying a preference to one candidate or another. The rest of the signs, though, are placed \u2013 and usually overly saturated \u2013 on public roadsides, town squares, and anywhere else there may be a tuft of grass to prop a sign.\n\nAlthough nearly every town in the country has laws against placing these \u2018election litter\u2019 signs on public property, few get removed, as towns don\u2019t have the time or money to send someone to toss them. Because of this, one Duluth, Minnesota man has taken the problem into his own hands, and has gone out every night for the last two weeks, removing hundreds and hundreds of political ads and signs that have been strewn across his hometown.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, the signs are just ugly, and it\u2019s some straight-up bulls\u2014 that they are strewn all around, cluttering up the scenery,\u201d said Carl Meadows, who Duluth residents are calling their \u2018political vigilante.\u2019 \u201cNo one likes these signs. They are just stupid. I also can\u2019t figure out what the point of them really is. If you\u2019re a Republican, you\u2019re probably going to vote Republican. Ditto that for Democrats. Everyone else votes for their candidate of choice.

Science professor at Chicago University Myles Kent was at the forefront of getting paper bags banned along with plastic throughout Illinois.\n\n\u201cJust for paper bags alone, more than 14 million trees are cut down annually,\u201d said Kent. \u201cIt takes almost 4 times as much energy, and causes almost 70% more air pollutants to make a paper bag than it does to make a plastic bag. Banning plastic is nonsense.

It has been suggested that you sew together your old clothes into make-shift bags. Pants with deep pockets might work for small trips. We also urge consumers to consider just tying a bandana to a stick, hobo-style.

They will need oil for other, more important things than bags, like getting around in cars or making kitschy plastic gifts.

In this state, if you are underage and your parents come in with you and agree that it is okay, then it\u2019s not illegal. I don\u2019t see the problem here.

Once people stop listening, then the crap just seems that much\u2026crappier. We have taken this action because we feel it is crucial for the future health and political success of our current and seriously divided mainstream GOP.\n\nOver the last several years, there have been many setbacks to the Tea Party movement. Original Tea Party member Eric Cantor lost his bid for re-election in June 2014 to newcomer and college professor David Brat. Florida Representative Allen West narrowly lost his bid for reelection to political novice Patrick Murphy in November 2012. Plus, former Alaska Governor and 2008 GOP Vice-Presidential Nominee Sarah Palin also aligned herself with the movement and remains highly vocal \u2013 which might be the biggest setback of all for the party.\n\nThe Tea Party unofficially got started during a February 2009 speech from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange when CNBC commentator Rick Santelli made reference to the original Boston Tea Party revolt of 1773. Santelli proposed a Chicago \u2018Tea Party\u2019 style uprising to oppose government intrusion into the housing market. At the time, President Barack Obama\u2019s mortgage relief bailout plan faced widespread opposition and criticism.\n\nA faction of the new party used racially-charged symbolism and rhetoric aimed directly at Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first African-American President, causing further divisions and contributing to the party\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cAt a time when our GOP leadership was achieving limited success in attracting a more diverse base,\u201d explained Rubio, \u201cunfortunate events were taking place, with no clear direction toward party cohesion.

The woman, who so far has only been listed in the press as \u2018Samille,\u2019 has not been fully identified. It is still unclear if that is a pseudonym. So far, the only information that appears to be accurate is that the affair has taken place over several years.\n\n\u2018Samille\u2019 was not directly hired by Clinton, and reports indicate it may have been someone who had worked within the White House for many years, possibly meeting Hillary as far back as when her husband was President. Sources within the White House say that they spent so much time together \u2018working,\u2019 and having late-night meetings, that people began to wonder if there was something illicit happening almost as far back as 2012. The alleged affair officially came to light when a White House staffer, who had set up a meeting with Hillary, showed up 15 minutes early only to find the lovers kissing.\n\nSince the accusations, Samille has admitted to it happening a lot more than once, and is claiming that she couldn\u2019t help her emotions towards the former first lady.\n\n\u201cI mean it was something about the power, and the political presence that she holds. Plus, my God \u2013 the pantsuits are to die for, you know? They just set a fire in my heart\u2026and between my legs,\u201d said Samille via email to the Associated Press.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton, who was first confronted with the news by reporters who caught him out to dinner on a business meeting, was asked if this would be the end of his marriage with Hillary.\n\n\u201cOh God, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think if anything at this point we would be considered even,\u201d said former president Clinton, not at all taken aback by the news of his wife\u2019s alleged infidelity. \u201cShe stood by me while I diddled everything that walked into the Oval Office, or Oral Office, as I liked to call it, haha. It\u2019s high time she took the stick out and had a little fun, if you know what I mean. I just hope this might parlay into a little mixing-together-three, if you catch my drift.\u201d\n\nPolitical analysts are saying that the news breaking at this time might actually be good for Clinton, especially if she has any plans on running for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhen the truth came out about [Bill] Clinton giving Monica Lewinsky the ol\u2019 heave-ho, and Hillary stood by him for some stupid reason, people called her a coward and a wimp. The claimed she didn\u2019t have the nerve to leave her husband because he was president, when any other woman on the face of the planet would have just said \u201csayonara,'\u201d said political analyst for the Washington Post Times, Bill Reed. \u201cThis turns everything on its head. This will get her the vote if she runs in 2016. Women will begin to love her for that strong sense of womanhood, and men might actually find her appealing now, because all men fantasize about two women going at it. Even if one of them is Hillary Clinton, who has the sex appeal of a school house fire.\u201d\n\nAs of this time, there has been no official statement given by Hillary Clinton or anyone from within her political party.

In a press conference this morning from the White House, President Obama admitted that he had forged his birth certificate, and that he was not a natural-born U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that I was not born here in this great country,\u201d said the President in his speech. \u201cThat does not mean, though, that I have not led us through some great times. I have fought hard to make sure we are protected. I almost single-handedly killed that son of a b\u2014- bin Laden. I have driven us into, and then right back out of, a horrible recession. I knew what needed to be done to get to where I am, and so I had to make it happen.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has been the talk of many conspiracy theories over the course of his presidency, beginning while he was still running for office. At one point in time, a poll showed that over 50% of people in the Republican party thought that Obama had forged his birth certificate, and that he was not constitutionally allowed to be president. These people, often referred to as \u2018birthers\u2019, hold onto one of several theories, including that the president was born in Kenya, that he is a dual US/UK citizen, or that he is of Indonesian citizenship. The rumors and theories became so bad that in 2008, President Obama released what is now being found to be a forged birth certificate, stating he was born in Hawaii.\n\n\u201cI had to do what I did to become president,\u201d continued Obama. \u201cYes, the birth certificate is a forgery. No, I was not born in Hawaii \u2013 my God, do I even look like I was born in Hawaii? Don\u2019t answer that, actually. Regardless \u2013 as your elected leader, I plan to continue to run this country the best that I can for the remainder of my term, and prove to everyone that a strong leader can come from anywhere, and still take over this great land.\u201d\n\nBefore the announcement, President Obama went through the motions of giving himself an executive pardon, making it impossible to stand accountable for breaking the law, something that until this presidency, no one had ever considered possible.\n\n\u201cI have pardoned myself for my crimes, and for lying to the country,\u201d said the President. \u201cTherefore, I will not be able to be arrested or taken into custody. In the eyes of our great judicial system, I have now done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nDespite the shock of the announcement, and the surprise of the pardon, many reporters at the White House were still wondering where Obama was actually born, if the entire time his birth certificate had just been a ruse.\n\n\u201cI am so glad that you asked that,\u201d said Obama. \u201cTo be truthful \u2013 no, I am not from this great nation. Nor was I born in Kenya. To be fair, I am actually not even of this world.

It is highly disrespectful and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s mostly illegal, as several of the girls in Mr. Creek\u2019s class were underage,\u201d said Superintendent of Schools Melissa Dyer.\n\nCreek, 36, has been a coach or a gym teacher at a number of New England schools over the last decade, and was most recently let go by a school in Concord, New Hampshire, for separating the homosexual students in his classes from the other students. It was reported that he would force the students to do arts and crafts, sewing or \u201cother gay activities,\u201d as opposed to the sports and games the rest of the class would partake in.\n\nWhen asked why Creek, who had such a spotty record, would be hired at Hardin School, Dyer said that she was not made aware until recently why Creek had been let go by his previous employers, and only that he portrayed himself as a great teacher with a lot of great ideas to keep the kids healthy and active.\n\n\u201cHe also wasn\u2019t a scary, militant lesbian, which is what we have predominantly have had in the past for our physical education teachers. Generally our gym teachers haven\u2019t been well liked by the students in the past,\u201d said Dyer.\n\nStudents in Creek\u2019s classes seemed to be un-phased by being forced to play topless in gym class.

People thought I was like, a freak or something, I guess. I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends,\u201d Said Hamlin, a senior. \u201cOnce Mr. Creek started forcing us into the shirts and skins games, boys started noticing me a lot more. I guess once my shirt came off and they got to see what they were missing out on, they actually noticed me. My Friday nights are always booked now. I\u2019m so thankful for Mr. Creek!\u201d\n\nParents are outraged, though, at Creek\u2019s behavior, and most are calling for not only his job, but his literal head on a platter.\n\n\u201cThis kind of disgusting pervertism cannot be tolerated,\u201d said Regina George, murdering the English language. \u201cI am the mother of 3 young, teen girls here, and I can\u2019t believe that we have this man oogling our children\u2019s dirty pillows. I am sickened. 2 of my girls, Katie and Felicity are not, well, you know \u2013 endowed. Now my girls have spats at home all the time, because my oldest, Samantha, gets all the attention from the boys at school. These games have ruined their self-esteem and their social lives.\u201d\n\nSo far, Creek himself has not commented publicly, except to say that he was not doing anything wrong. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have enough colored jerseys to go around, so I improvised. It was not sexual at all. At least not as far as I was concerned,\u201d said Creek in a prepared statement via his lawyer.\n\nCurrently, Creek will be on a multi-week suspension with pay until school officials decide what to do about his position. As of this writing, no legal charges had been filed by the school district or the parents of any of the students. Curiously, no one within the school offices, or parents of any children, seemed phased by the fact that Creek also forced boys into participating in the activities while bottomless.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Republican Party Plans to Change Symbol From Elephant To Yacht": ["https://empirenews.net/republican-party-plans-to-change-symbol-from-elephant-to-yacht/", "0\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013\n\nIn an attempt to appeal to all demographics, the Republican Party has announced plans to change its symbol from the iconic, steadfast image of the elephant, to a yacht.

PETERSBURG, Florida \u2013\n\nA local St. Petersburg man is behind bars today after a bizarre event occurred while fishing. Tim Pope, age 64, was arrested late Sunday evening by police officers for tampering with a crime scene. Pope was fishing in a Florida river early Sunday morning, which his wife says he has been doing every Sunday for the past 20 years.\n\n\u201cEver since we moved to Florida 20 years ago, he would go to that river and fish every Sunday,\u201d said Mrs. Pope. \u201cIf some people go to Church or watch football as their religion of choice, then Tim\u2019s religions is fishing.\u201d\n\nWhile out early this morning, Pope inadvertently hooked a human corpse \u2013 something that any die-hard fisherman can tell you is not as nice as hooking a huge bass. Like any good fisherman, though, when realizing that what he had pulled to shore was of a sub-par nature, he threw the body back in the water.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to speak to him to much, but he told me he didn\u2019t know what to do with the body. At first, pulling it in, he thought he had caught the biggest fish of his life. When he discovered it wasn\u2019t a fish at all, he just unhooked it and tossed it back. [Tim] doesn\u2019t own a cell phone, so a few hours later when he finally was finished and arrived home, he told me the story and I had him call the police. Stupid me, because their first stop after the call was to our house to arrest him for tampering with the body!\u201d said Mrs. Pope.\n\nTim Pope is still currently in lockup in St. Petersburg, after refusing to take any money out of his retirement savings to post bail. If he\u2019s convicted of a crime, he could be facing several years behind bars. The arresting officers have refused to make a statement, but the station has reportedly been receiving a lot of angry calls from local town residents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says about it,\u201d said Pope during his initial police interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I didn\u2019t kill the guy, I just pulled him in. What was I supposed to do? It\u2019s not like he was going to fit in my cooler. Would you have arrested me if I\u2019d caught a tire in my line and threw that back? Littering is a crime too, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cTim is friends with a lot of people in our neighborhood, and I know that along with myself, people have been calling the police station night and day expressing how they feel. My husband doesn\u2019t deserve to be jailed for this; it was a fisherman\u2019s instinct to throw the body back in the river,\u201d said Mrs. Pope.\n\nPolice have continued to search for the body over several miles of river, but so far have come up empty-handed. Reports indicate that police are actually using Pope\u2019s confiscated fishing rod and lures in attempt to hook the body for a second time.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Family Sues Fortune Cookie Manufacturer After Finding Filthy Fortunes": ["https://empirenews.net/family-sues-fortune-cookie-manufacturer-after-finding-filthy-fortunes/", "0\n\nCARMEL, New York \u2013\n\nA fun family trip quickly turned into a nasty nightmare for the Bryant family of upstate Carmel, New York, after several lewd \u201cnovelty\u201d fortune cookies were mistakenly placed on their table.\n\nJoy and Matt Bryant planned a day of fun for Joy\u2019s parents, Eloise and Earl, and for their 6-year-old daughter, Angela.\n\n\u201cIt was Mum and Dad\u2019s anniversary.

During today\u2019s morning press briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked where Biden had been all week.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea. Last time we saw Joe he got everybody involved in this elaborate game of hide-n-seek, and insisted he would come out the winner. That was a week ago today. The man has a competitive spirit that is out of this world. He will pop up eventually,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nIt is not uncommon for Biden to lead White House staff into late night adventures of extreme games during after hours. Last month Biden came up with the idea to have Halloween in August for all staffers, and made it mandatory for them to dress up and take part in a White House wide game of \u2018Zombie Paintball War.\u2019 The object of the game, to make it until sunrise with two or less paintball hits. Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough teamed with Dr. Jill Biden and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett for the victory. An argument ensued after Vice President Biden claimed that the winning team had cheated and did not speak to his wife for three days and slept on the sofa in the Deputy Chief of Staffs office.\n\nAfter the argument over what was supposed to be a fun game, President Obama said that he called Biden into the Oval office for a long talk. \u201cI said, \u2018Now Joe, it is just a game. You all need to learn to play nice and act like big kids. I know you like to win, but you aren\u2019t always going to win. You can\u2019t just go accusing everyone of cheating.\u2019 I then looked him in the eye and said, \u2018Now who is my #1 Joe? You are!\u2019 I even pulled out my rolled up Slip-N-Slide, which I always keep hidden from him in the Resolute desk, and I let him take it into the hallways to play. I tell you, he lit up like a Christmas tree. He is a sensitive, yet strong man,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cI know one thing, he sure schooled us on this game of Hide-N-Seek,\u201d said Earnest. \u201cThat\u2019s just the kinda guy he is, a real gamer.

Sadly, one curious kitten did just that, and Pretty Much Polly turned out not to be the perfect Polly toy for the small kitty.\n\nTeleToy Corporation INC., distributor of Pretty Much Polly, has been named as defendant in a lawsuit filed by Edna Wannamaacher on behalf of Mittens Wannamaacher.

One day, I was pouring foundation for that new development over by Harbor Road and Mittens kind of adopted me. Next thing I knew, he was my newest roommate! He followed me home.

We are not responsible for any damages.\u201d\n\n\u201cObjection, your honor,\u201d shouted Edna\u2019s nephew, Dewey Wannamaacher, during closing arguments. When Dewey was reminded that he was not an attorney and that closing arguments can not be interrupted, he begged for the court\u2019s mercy, asking that his statement be heard and entered into the record. The request was granted over Sandy\u2019s objections.\n\n\u201cMy aunt is not a crazy cat lady. She does not train her cats to use the toilet like some nuts. In fact, she has opted herself to just use clumping litter along with her friends instead. A lot of slanderous things have been said about her in court today. Yes, she once took a selfie for Cat Fancy magazine, showing her eating from a bowl of Meow Mix with a slew of cats, but it was just for fun. Sadly, that photograph has now come to haunt our family nine-times over. It\u2019s on the Internet, and\u2026well, people can be so cruel. By my aunt is a wonderful person, and this case should not be about her life, but rather the life, and death, of Mittens Wannamaacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of toy makers and yarn manufacturers could face loss of livelihoods,\u201d countered Sandy. \u201cEven the entire string industry could be wiped out over a case like this. Is that fair? I think not. We all love cats, yes, but also \u2014 members of the jury \u2014 I implore you \u2014 also think of the sheep. There\u2019s more at stake here than just the future of one toy line. It\u2019s the future of the entire cat industry! This could set a precedent that could potentially wipe out laser pointers and catnip manufacturers as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d hate to put people out of work,\u201d said Edna, as the jury deliberated for a second day. \u201cA lot of my friends work with toys and string. But what about Mittens? Who is going to speak for her? She was just following her natural instincts and look where she ended up? Dead and under the recliner, that\u2019s where. Mittens would have been better off left in that construction lot, looking back on it.\u201d\n\nUnofficial reports have surfaced hinting that the jury may be deadlocked.\n\n\u201cI took a good look at the jury, said Wannamaacher. \u201cI think half of them are dog people, and the other half are cat people.

ISIS is an al Qaeda splinter group that wants to establish an Islamic state that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria.\n\n\u201cIn the G.I.

In the real world, ISIS is also run by a shadowy operative, and although it is not 100% known if he partakes in the same dark headwear often, one can only assume that he\u2019s taking cues directly from our action figure line.

Ronda McCracken, born Robert McCracken, a post-op third grade teacher for Montpelier Public Schools, has filed a civil suit claiming discrimination and emotional damages. Named in the suit are Montpelier Public Schools and Superintendent of Education Marshall Peterson.\n\n\u201cUntil this year, Ronda McCracken was employed by Montpelier Public Schools under the name \u2018Robert McCracken.\u2019 Over the break, Mr. McCracken underwent gender reassignment surgery and reported in to last weeks Board of Education meeting as a female,\u201d said Principal Richard Belding. \u201cBeing an equal opportunity employer, and in appreciation of McCracken\u2019s years of service to the school system, Superintendent Peterson informed Ms. McCracken that Montpelier Schools would be glad to allow her to retain the position that she had previously held as a man. The one condition was that Ms. McCracken would refrain from using the women\u2019s restrooms on school grounds. The Board felt that it would be more appropriate for Ms. McCracken to use the unisex restroom located in the teacher\u2019s lounge. Ms. McCracken seemed to be fine with the decision initially, but later placed a call to the Superintendent stating that she felt she was being discriminated against. She was informed that, unfortunately, the Board could not see fit to reverse the decision for fear of public backlash. Ms. McCracken then filed suit against the Board.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, when asked about the suit, Ms. McCracken had no problem sharing her opinion.\n\n\u201cI just felt like they [Montpelier Public Schools] were discriminating against me for something that was beyond my control. I was born a woman, I just had the wrong equipment. There is a long history of discrimination in this country, and I feel these people need to be held accountable for their bigoted actions. There is no reason, besides unwarranted prejudice, that a woman should not be allowed to use the restroom with other females.\u201d\n\nSome of the Montpelier parents had a different point of view. Carl Mitchum, father of two elementary age students in Montpelier Schools, shared his opinion with Empire News.\n\n\u201cRobert McCracken was born a man. All this gay and lesbian equal rights talk is fine by me, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want a grown man winding up in a bathroom with my eight year old daughter. It\u2019s not safe, and it is a precedent that we can not allow to be set.\u201d\n\nOther parents of children at the school were not nearly as kind in their opinions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that freak in the bathroom with those poor girls. There is too much risk. If God had wanted a Ronda McCracken, then Ronda McCracken would have been born, not made by soulless doctors.

Maybe people don\u2019t understand my lifestyle, but they don\u2019t have to me so mean. The idea that we should tell our children what gender they are is outdated. These people are ignorant bigots.

The program, initiated by President Barrack Obama, is very similar to what is now widely known to the public as \u201cThe Obama Phone,\u201d where welfare recipients can get free cell phone service through a subsidized program. Some are even already referring to the free vehicle program as \u201cThe Obama Car.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest announced the launching of the program in a late press briefing yesterday evening. \u201cThe free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100. Any United States Citizen receiving welfare benefits qualifies for the program, which will be starting on January 5, 2015.\u201d said Earnest.\n\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this will be the downfall of President Obama. \u201cThis absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this. But I will tell you this, it is the beginning of the end for the Obama administration, Americans are fed up, and they are being called to the post,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the impeachment hearings begin, mark my words.\u201d\n\nEarnest said in the briefing that the campaign is intended to help unemployed Americans find secure employment, and ultimately will cause the unemployment rate to drop significantly. \u201cEvery American deserves the right to possess the ability to get themselves to a good job. Public transportation is very limited for most of the unemployed, especially in rural areas. This free vehicle assistance program is designed to change the way Americans are currently living. The President will sign the bill later this week, and the planning will be put into motion.\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThere is sure to be public outrage along with intense approval from American citizens.

All we are doing is giving criminals and scum of the Earth the wheels to make their drug deals while using their Obama-phones to set the deals up. People who really want to work, find a way to get to work, they always have. The unemployed are just lazy and make zero effort to find steady work. They want the easy way out, and our so-called government gives it to them. This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nJuanita Jenkins of Albany, New York disagrees. \u201cI think it is an excellent thing our government is doing. There are plenty of unemployed Americans who just cannot get to a job. This is sure to improve the steadily improving economy. I am not on welfare myself, but I have been considering quitting my job and applying for assistance while I look for a better job. I guess that means I\u2019ll be in line for a car, too,\u201d Jenkins said eagerly.\n\nEarnest also told the press that the types of vehicles used for the program will be various American-made models, older than five years, but no more than ten years old.

I don\u2019t know, but I guess now I know what I should have known. It just couldn\u2019t last as long as I thought I knew it could.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview from his Fulton County holding cell, Mattias revealed that several of his friends eventually became aware of his illegal activities. \u201cI told them I already knew what they were gonna say and that they were right, but I was so far into it, I couldn\u2019t get out.

Already known for their harsh anti-immigration stance and for the kooky escapades of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the state is taking things a step further with a new law requiring that all immigrants must spend time in \u2018Americanization Camps\u2019 where they will learn English, and be quarantined temporarily to ensure that they aren\u2019t introducing any diseases into America. \u2018Sheriff Joe\u2019, who had little to do with the law, does happen to be a big supporter.\n\n\u201cHell yes I support this law! This is America, contrary to what the popular belief is these days, and if you want to live here, you had damn well better act like an American. There is no reason whatsoever that citizens of this country should have to tiptoe around and learn the language of an immigrating culture. I\u2019ve heard grumblings from the Indian population about European immigrants, and to be honest, they\u2019re one hundred percent correct. If we handle this influx of Mexicans in the same passive way that the Indians handled the Europeans, we\u2019ll suffer the same fate that they did. We\u2019ll be overrun and bred out. That is why this idea of \u2018assimilation before citizenship\u2019 appeals to me.\u201d\n\nBasically, the law states that all immigrants who will reside in Arizona will be \u2018confined and educated\u2019 for an undetermined amount of time. Supporters of the law claim that the confinement will not be unpleasant, and that the faster they learn the language and customs, the faster they will be released into society. Opponents of the law are uneasy with the \u2018undetermined amount of time\u2019 that the immigrants will be detained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d Said State Senator Maria Lopez. \u201cHow long before this gets abused?

At least there was a war then, a legitimate fear. It doesn\u2019t excuse it, but at least there was some reason for the hysteria. This law is based solely on racial prejudice. It is completely disgusting.\u201d\n\nSheriff Joe just laughs about the liberal concerns.\n\n\u201cThey always worry so much about the rights of people who haven\u2019t earned any rights. They cried when I put prisoners in tents in the desert. Well, those guys get out of there and they don\u2019t want to come back.

Early this morning, in an unprecedented move, the board decided to reverse their decision, and in a shocking turn of events and subsequently granted Chapman parole effective immediately. The decision came after an impromptu meeting was called by unnamed government official who chastised the parole board for showing \u201cpoor judgement\u201d and \u201cholding a celebrity in a higher standard than that of the average American citizen,\u201d New York corrections officials said.\n\nNew York Corrections spokesperson Glenn Abernathy told the Associated Press in a brief statement the reasons for the reversal.\n\n\u201cAfter further consideration, we decided to grant Mr. Chapman parole. It was made clear to us by outside forces that the murder of a celebrity should not mean a longer sentence than what is typically given. In 2013, a total of 116 inmates who were found guilty of murder were released from prison after serving less than a 10-year sentence. Mr. Chapman has served nearly 33 years, more than 3-times that amount. Also, he was cleared as mentally competent many years ago, meaning that there was no reason to deny his parole in the first place.\u201d said Abernathy. \u201c[Chapman] said after his initial arrest that he had plans to murder Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor, Walter Cronkite, Marlon Brando, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and that John Lennon was just the easiest to find. Well, everyone else he planned to kill is dead now anyway, so it was decided that he was no longer a threat to anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe parole board are made up of old fogies,\u201d said Jerome David, a self-professed \u2018super-fan\u2019 of Chapman. \u201cThey denied him parole at every opportunity because they were fans of Lennon, of the Beatles, growing up. So they look at him, and they see someone who helped destroy their youth. That isn\u2019t fair to [Chapman]. He deserves to be freed just like every other murderer they set free. The Beatles are a forgotten memory, anyway. Who really cares about them or John Lennon anymore? It\u2019s not the 60s. Personally, I\u2019ll be waiting at the gates to wave as they drive [Chapman] out!\u201d\n\nAccording to Abernathy, there was a decision made by the federal court system, calling the meeting with the purpose of reviewing the decision handed down on Wednesday by the parole board. It was then declared that the parole board did not have legitimate reasoning in denying the parole. The main issue discussed in the 3-hour meeting cited the fact that celebrities should not be given special treatment when the United States judicial system is involved, whether they are criminally involved or the victim.\n\n\u201cThe United States average sentence for convicted murderers is between 13 and 16 years,\u201d Abernathy told the New York Associated Press. \u201cChapman was sentenced to twenty-years to life in 1981, with a stipulation that mental health treatment be provided. \u201cMr. Chapman initially did not want to be released, due to his comfort within the system. However, at approximately 6:30 am this morning, he was given $200 cash and his copy of the book Catcher In The Rye, which he had when he was caught at the scene of the murder, and was given instructions to move into a half-way housing unit, which at this time will not be named.\u201d\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Chapman told ABC News that if released he would try to stay, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m so bonded that I could probably assure you that, if released, I\u2019d probably stay right where I\u2019m at,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cYou know, once you stand on a rock for 20 years and feel the waves on you and you don\u2019t go anywhere because you\u2019re on a rock, you don\u2019t want to move.\u201d\n\nCorrections officials at Wende Corrections Facility in Alden, New York, where Chapman was incarcerated, said that Chapman broke down in tears after being told of the parole board reversal. \u201cHe asked if he could please stay, he said he would work for free within the prison. When told he could not, under any circumstances voluntarily stay, he broke down and said his life was over,\u201d said corrections officer Alex Jameson.\n\nChapman is set to be transported to the half-way house on Monday morning.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Two Westboro Baptist Church Members Arrested, Accused Of Child Molestation": ["https://empirenews.net/two-westboro-baptist-church-members-arrested-accused-of-child-molestation/", "0\n\nTOPEKA, Kansas \u2013\n\nTwo members of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church have been arrested on child molestation charges, according to Topeka Police Department spokesperson Michelle Somerville.\n\n51-year-old Parker Eugene Williamson and his 38-year-old wife, Janelle Williamson, both reportedly members of the Westboro Baptist Church, were arrested and booked early this morning. Due to the nature of the arrest, details of the molestation charges have been sealed under court order by Shawnee County judge Herman Jacoby. However, Somerville was able to share with the media that the couple were also facing charges of drug possession, animal cruelty, and resisting arrest.\n\n\u201cA warrant was issued to search the Williamson residence. Inside police discovered a bedroom in the house had been chained and padlocked from the outside. I can tell you that there was a child, the couples only son, and three neglected, malnourished dogs, no other details about what was uncovered in that room cannot be disclosed at this time,\u201d Somerville said. \u201cOf course, they also had a room filled with ridiculous, nonsensical signs they use when picketing. I think that\u2019s a prerequisite for these people.\u201d\n\nThe arrests took place just days after the church announced plans to picket the funeral of famed actor and comedian Robin Williams. Westboro Baptist Church members are known for their picketing of United States soldiers who have died in battle, celebrities, and mostly for their extreme anti-gay standing. Thankfully, they were not aware that Williams had requested cremation, and his ashes were scattered quietly without incident from the Church.\n\nShirley Phelps-Roper, the daughter of deceased WBC founder Fred Phelps, was reached by telephone shortly after the arrests were made, and she blatantly refused comment on the matter, claiming she didn\u2019t know the Williamsons, and that anyone who asked would surely \u2018burn in hell like all the other fag enablers.\u2019\n\nDue to the anti-gay stance of the church, and their supposed technique of only using words and no violence, an organization named Planting Peace, who opposes the church and is located right across the street from their home, is planning to continue to raise money in the name of overpowering WBC\u2019s hate by getting people to donate money to charitable causes.\n\nStanley Unser of Planting Peace had this to said that their organization said they would take donations for suicide prevention, in honor of Williams. \u201cThe WBC might not have been able to picket a funeral for a well-loved celebrity, but they planned it. They think these are good things. Death is good. They\u2019re sickos.\u201d\n\nWestboro Baptist Church has become more of a laughing-stock to the public in over time, with internet hatred giving way to peaceful, almost comedic, public protest. Those people who oppose the church, which obviously includes almost every living person on the planet, have increasingly set out to make a mockery of Westboro, mocking their well-known signs and picketing right along with them. People have taken to making their own versions of the hateful signs, using such slogans as \u201cGod Hates Signs,\u201d and \u201cGod, My Sharpies Are Drying Out\u201d and posing along with church members, taking selfies to post on the internet.\n\n\u201cBased on the number of funny signs, memes, and images found on the internet, it seems that the WBC is losing ground,\u201d says University of Kansas behavioral sciences professor Dr. Carmen Fiorucci. \u201cIt truly seems to be that society has always been sickened by the group, which in my opinion is a hate group, even though the White House would not label them as such, but nobody is taking them seriously anymore. They make signs with hateful messages on them, that is their only form of spreading their gospel, which is really just bull\u2014-, and it\u2019s not spreading anymore. They have become a joke to society. The kids making signs to mock them and pose in front of them for photos, and good for them! It shows these loons have been defeated. If these members are proven to have committed the crimes which have been alleged, the burning of the church has begun, you can count on that.\u201d\n\nSomerville stated that the investigating of alleged crimes is being handled with the \u2018utmost diligence,\u2019 and details will be released at the proper time.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Breastfeeding Activists Plan \u2018Bare Breasts At Work Day\u2019": ["https://empirenews.net/breastfeeding-activists-plan-bare-breasts-at-work-day/", "0\n\nSEATTLE, Washington \u2013\n\nThere have been many news stories as of late regarding public breastfeeding, and the issues that arise when mothers are caught feeding their children in view of others. Many people feel that breastfeeding is a natural act and should be allowed and respected in any forum, while others are of the opinion that breastfeeding should be done in a more private setting.\n\nWith all the attention as of late, one public breastfeeding activist group has decided that it is time to take a stand. Patricia Oseland, president of \u2018Mommy\u2019s Milk\u2019, a national public breastfeeding awareness group based in Seattle, Washington, has called her members into action. The women of the group are staging a \u2018Bare Your Breasts At Work Day\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe idea is simple,\u201d Oseland said in a Youtube video that already has over one million views. \u201cBreasts are a mother\u2019s way of feeding her children, but they have been sexualized by men, and we are forced to cover them up. \u2018Bare Your Breasts At Work Day\u2019 is our chance to take back our breasts from the perverts in society and use them in the way they were intended to be used \u2013 as a source of nutrition for our offspring.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, September twenty-second, I ask all of you to bare your breasts at your job. If you are not employed, go shopping, go to the zoo with the kids, go anywhere; but whatever you do, do it with bare breasts. The goal, no, the calling, of \u2018Mommy\u2019s Milk\u2019 is to escape the stigma of our sexualized bodies and normalize the sight of bare breasts in public. We realize that we will not receive a positive reaction from everyone regarding our decision, but we do not care. We will not abandon our ideals. We will not be defeated. We will never give up. Breasts will be a normal part of our everyday lives once again.\u201d\n\nSupporters of public breastfeeding are voicing their support, and thousands of women have committed themselves to the cause. Youtube user Hippychik69 expressed her support in the video\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI am not a mother, but I am lending my breasts to your cause. I will be working topless. I hope many more join us. We can make a difference ladies!\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the coin, there are many people who feel that the move goes beyond activism and is more pornographic than it is educational. Madeline Smith, a mother of four and grandmother of seven doesn\u2019t feel like the event is going to have any positive effect on public opinion regarding breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on this Earth for seventy-three years. I know people. You don\u2019t sway others to your cause by forcing your beliefs down their throats. All that will happen here is that the opposition will grow more militant and set in their ways. If these women want to look like cheap floozies all day and lose their jobs in the process, that\u2019s fine, but it won\u2019t do anything but make them look stupid.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bare Your Breasts At Work Day\u2019 has plenty of support from young mothers, but seems to be most popular with males age thirteen to forty-nine. Mark Harmon, a sophomore at Seattle Community College, says he is \u2018pretty excited\u2019 about the whole thing.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t care what they are \u2018raising awareness\u2019 for.\u201d Harmon told a Seattle reporter. \u201cIf they want to take their shirts off, I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s certainly going to \u2018raise a little awareness\u2019 in me, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nSeattle authorities, along with other police forces in other cities, have promised indecent exposure arrests if \u2018Mommy\u2019s Milk\u2019 does not call off their demonstration. Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole is not amused by the movement.\n\n\u201cI am a mother, and I support breastfeeding, but this is taking things too far.

There are ledgers, account numbers, signed directives, and all manner of incriminating evidence irrevocably linking CIA agents to hundreds of major felonies; but that\u2019s not the worst part. The defector, one William Kingsley, has released the outline of a new plot to release an even more powerful drug into our nations cities.\n\nThere have long been conspiracy theories regarding the introduction of crack cocaine into American inner-cities by the Central Intelligence Agency. The \u2018tin-foil hat\u2019 crowd has always been convinced that Contras and independent contractors flew cocaine-laden planes into the airport at Mena, Arkansas, under the supervision of Colonel Oliver North; and with the cooperation of then-Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton. According to stories and reports by ghosts and dead men, the cocaine was then sold to finance black operations undertaken by the CIA. Coups were staged with drug profits, revolutions were initiated with blood money. It was a dirty, risky business, and many lives were lost or ruined in the process. At least, that\u2019s what the Infowars set would have you believe. Most logical people dismissed the whole thing as the delusions of madmen; at least that is, until now.\n\nAgent Kingsley, a West Point graduate and former intelligence officer, spent thirty years building a career as a high-level analyst in the Central Intelligence Agency, and no one is sure exactly why he chose to leave it all behind. The CIA is working hard to dismiss and discredit Kingsley as an extremist, but extremist or no, there is no disputing the credibility of the information he has released thus far. In his latest release of information via prepared statement, posted on various social networks and forums, Kingsley outlined the plan to release the new drug.\n\n\u201cThe CIA has developed a new drug which gives the euphoric rush of cocaine, has the addictive qualities of heroin, with little risk of overdose. It is easily and cheaply produced, but requires listed chemicals and complex laboratory equipment. The goal was to keep costs down while making the drug nearly impossible to manufacture on the streets. After months of formulations, they hit the nail on the head. The Agency has not given the drug an official name, but for the time being, it is being referred to as \u2018super crack\u2019. The drug will be produced in several forms, to target the various types of users.\u201d\n\nThe formula released by Kingsley has been tested by independent chemists and confirmed to be highly narcotic, and dangerously addictive. Dr Leo Marvin, a highly respected research pharmacist and organic chemist examined the formula and was shocked by its potency.\n\n\u201cThis compound replicates dopamine and oxytocin at a rate that would nearly overwhelm the brain\u2019s receptors. To return to baseline levels of those neurotransmitters after such an experience would no doubt render a person nearly suicidally depressed. A person addicted to a drug like this would be willing to pay any cost necessary to keep it in their system. The profit margin would be nearly unlimited,\u201d Dr Marvin said, after his study of the compound.\n\nAgent Kingsley asserts that the CIA plans to use the drug not only as a form of revenue, but also as a method of producing subservient and mindless zombies who can be controlled by manipulation of their addiction. He has provided pages of notes regarding the development of the drug and its possible uses.\n\n\u201cImagine an army that doesn\u2019t care about death or morality. That\u2019s what the Agency wants. They are going to use this drug as a multiplier or a lever. A hit-man will kill a man for ten thousand dollars. A junkie will do it for a fix. For ten thousand dollars, they can make thousands of fixes. You do the math.\u201d\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Say Goodbye To Privacy: NSA To Share Personal Data With Employers Upon Request": ["https://empirenews.net/say-goodbye-to-privacy-nsa-to-share-personal-data-with-employers-at-their-request/", "0\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013\n\nThe National Security Agency, which has been under intense scrutiny since Edward Snowden spilled the beans about the level of personal information they collect, has announced a new information sharing program they hope will ingratiate them with businesses across America. NSA public relations liaison Michael Phillips explained the program in a press release.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this program is for the NSA to express our gratitude to the businesses whose tax dollars support our operation. While our primary focus remains the gathering of intelligence for national security purposes, we collect a lot of information that is of no use to us, but would be of great use to employers. For instance, we can provide detailed records of your employees\u2019 or prospective employees\u2019 internet browsing habits, phone records, and in some cases, much more. Background checks and references only go so far. If you really need to know who you\u2019re hiring, you can find out, and the NSA can help. All you need to take advantage of the program is a government-issued business tax ID number.\u201d\n\nWhile some companies are more than happy to take advantage of the program, others are afraid of the message it will send to their employees. Frank Vargas, owner of a large automotive paint distributor in Austin, Texas, expressed some of his concerns.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to know about the people they associate with on a daily basis, but this seems a little extreme. Do we really want people to have that kind of access to our personal lives? Our thoughts? What scares me is, some people are going to love this, take full advantage of it. Is it really fair to deny people employment based on an off-color joke sent in a text? There are things people do and say in their private lives that have no bearing on on their job performance. Hell, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve said something that might bar me from employment, but that\u2019s my business. Maybe it\u2019s time for us to re-evaluate who we have running our country.\u201d\n\nOther business owners are jumping on the surveillance bandwagon and not looking back. Steve Clemons, of Clemons and Son machining, thinks the program is great.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I run my business based on Christian values. I expect my employees to operate on the same moral level as I do. Since I joined the program, I have replaced seven employees. There was adultery, racism, and all manner of of immorality eating at the moral fabric of my company like a cancer. Thanks to the NSA, I was able to nip it in the bud, and hire some wholesome family men to replace the jerks I let go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole process was really easy, too,\u201d said Christopher Lewis, a restaurant owner from Chicago. \u201cI filled out a couple forms with the information I already had on the employees I wanted to check up on, sent it in along with a check, and they sent me packets of information. The whole thing took about 2 weeks. They sent me emails, Facebook private messages, even text messages. They had it all. It really helped in deciding who to keep, and who to replace. It also helps when looking to hire someone new.\u201d\n\nRegardless of individual public position on surveillance, the era of privacy seems to be in its twilight years, and the NSA is helping to usher in a new age \u2013 at least for those who can afford to pay for secrecy.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Waitress Arrested After Throwing Plate, Hitting Toddler In The Face": ["https://empirenews.net/waitress-arrested-after-throwing-plate-hitting-toddler-in-the-face/", "0\n\nPAWTUCKET, Rhode Island \u2013\n\nAn unnamed 20-month-old was rushed to the hospital after taking a flying dinner plate to the face at a Rhode Island Applebee\u2019s restaurant. According to witnesses, while busing a table, server Caitlin Jones, 22, was having a loud, heated argument with another server, she flung out her hand, throwing a plate down the aisle of customers. The dirty dish struck a young toddler, who was sitting in a booster seat at the end of a table, in the side of the face.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible. I saw the plate come flying out of her hand like a Frisbee. It hit that poor baby, and there was this awful pause before she starting wailing,\u201d said Shaniqua Jones, a patron who was seated in the next booth. \u201cPoor little child, blood was running down her face and getting into her macaroni and cheese. The waitress looked horrified. She started crying and apologizing right away. I don\u2019t think she meant to hit that baby, but it was her fault completely. The force she threw that plate with was like an Olympic discus champion. It was insane.\u201d\n\nPolice were called, and Jones was arrested for criminal negligence and assault. She was released on $4,000 bail later that day. Jones insists it was \u2018an accident,\u2019 and that she didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone.\n\n\u201cIt just slipped out of my hand, honest,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI didn\u2019t chuck the plate at the baby. I was just mad at Denise because she has been talking s\u2014 about me behind my back at work, and we were arguing, and I just got so upset I whipped the plate, not even thinking.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time toddlers have been endangered at Applebee\u2019s. In 2011, a mislabeled container caused a mix-up that led to a toddler being served alcohol instead of apple juice.\n\n\u201cExcept for delicious family dining, no incidents have occurred at any Applebee\u2019s establishment since the unfortunate booze/bottle mishap. At that time, we took additional measures to ensure the safety of our guests. Sadly, this type of horrible accident, regarding the baby being struck with a plate, is not something we could foresee,\u201d said Johnathan Applebee, founder of Applebee\u2019s restaurants. \u201cWe have started production on a training video, though, to educate our servers about the risks of negligent plate-throwing, and the dangers it can present. Unless guests want us to switch to paper plates, I think that\u2019s the best can we do right now.\u201d\n\nThe parents of the toddler say they do not blame, nor have any plans to sue the restaurant chain itself, but are possibly seeking damages from Jones for hospital bills for their baby. Regardless of pending civil action, they say they do plan to make sure that Jones is held responsible for her actions.\n\n\u201cThat girl, she needs some serious help. Who throws a plate, honestly?\u201d said the mother of the young child, who wishes to remain anonymous pending the possible civil action against Jones. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very lucky that my daughter is going to be okay. She\u2019s also very, very lucky I didn\u2019t knock her out right there in the restaurant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am horribly sorry for what happened, and it isn\u2019t the restaurant\u2019s fault at all,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI know it was me. I maybe, sorta was drinking a lot the night before, and I was just in a bad mood. Frankly, life as a waitress is a living hell, you know? Trying to pretend to be happy all day when you\u2019re serving microwaved steak that tastes a little too much like ass sweat? Ugh, it\u2019s a real chore being me, you don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nApplebee\u2019s restaurants deny all culpability for the incident, and immediately fired Jones.

Around the Missouri border it has gone viral at an exponential pace, prompting action from the city council.\n\n\u201cThese people are dumping buckets of ice water on their heads, wasting millions of gallons per day,\u201d Says Sly James, the Mayor of Kansas City. \u201cIt was great at first because donations were pouring in to local chapters for research on ALS, but after the first couple of days panic ensued for us representatives.\u201d\n\nJames is referring to a serious environmental problem faced by the city in the last few weeks. \u201cPeople are dumping five gallon buckets, 10 gallon buckets, and heck, even bucket loaders full of water on themselves, which would all be well and good, if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a drought,\u201d says Meteorologist Katie Horner. \u201cWe are experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, and wasting all this water when the whole point was to get people donating to a charity is asinine.\u201d\n\nKansas City alone has lost water due to drought, enough so that more rural portions of the city are going without it, as well as the rest of the city having to ration their water. \u201cRestaurants have shut down, people are not allowed to shower, a family of five is only rationed ten gallons of water every other day,\u201d Says James. \u201cThese people need to realize that for all the positivity they are spreading by making ALS known, they are also devastating our ecosystem, which in recent years has become extremely fragile. There is always two sides to the coin.\u201d\n\nWith no sign of stopping, people in Missouri have decided to stop using the tap and have gone to lakes and rivers to get their water, with equal detriment to the environment surrounding. \u201cIt goes without saying that people in general need to be a part of something,\u201d says anthropologist Robert Layton. \u201cIt is unfortunate that in today\u2019s social age they need to grasp on to internet, to notoriety or fame so much that they refuse to see what they are doing to their home town.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to put out a bulletin banning the ice bucket challenge,\u201d Says James. \u201cWe just can\u2019t have people potentially dying for no reason other than to get out of donating money to research. People should just make videos showing them donating. \u2018ALS is a big deal, let\u2019s take it out!\u2019 and then fork over $10. That\u2019s what the challenge was supposed to be about. Apparently somewhere along the line, people forgot the \u2018donate\u2019 part, and just started wasting water.\u201d\n\nAlthough the \u2018challenge\u2019 has brought in over $1 million more than the ALS foundation would have normally received by this time in years past, representatives for the foundation say that if people actually donated when they did the challenge, they\u2019d have much more.\n\n\u201cOriginally the challenge was someone nominates you, and you have 24 hours to either complete the challenge AND donate $10, or you would not complete the challenge at all, and you had to donate $100,\u201d said Marsha Farmington, representative for the ALS foundation. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had people donate. Yes, we\u2019ve had people donate more than $100, even. But I have to say, based on how many videos I see in my Facebook feed every day of people dumping buckets over their head, most people who do the challenge remember to film it, they remember to tag friends, and they remember to post it on the internet. The thing they forget is to donate the $10.\u201d\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Police Accidentally Fire Laughing Gas at Ferguson, MO Protesters": ["https://empirenews.net/police-accidentally-fire-laughing-gas-at-ferguson-mo-protesters/", "0\n\nFERGUSON, Missouri \u2013\n\nAmidst rising tensions and violence stemming from the police shooting and subsequent death of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown comes an unintended moment of unplanned and ill-timed levity.\n\nMembers of the Ferguson police department used incorrectly labeled canisters of nitrous oxide, more commonly known as \u2018laughing gas\u2019 against a crowd of demonstrators assembled for a peaceful protest.\n\nAt an evening press conference during the melee, Chief of police Thomas Jackson remarked, \u201cIn our haste to assess and control the situation and to clear the immediate and surrounding vicinity, several of our officers utilized the wrong supply of materials.\u201d\n\nStifling a bout of laughter, Jackson continued, \u201cThey grabbed the \u2026 they grabbed the wrong cans!\u201d After several minutes, Jackson regained his composure and continued. \u201cNow is the time for law, order, and peace to return to our community.

This tax on sugar would go straight into funding all medical research \u2013 not just those common ailments \u2013 but all medical research,\u201d House speaker John Boehner said.\n\nThe sugar tax bill is expected to triple the cost of foods high in unnatural amounts of fructose such as carbonated beverages, candies, frozen novelties, and over 700 other foods and drinks.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill is a good thing.

The water hazard is located above a natural aquifer made up of sand and gravel, and serves as an essential ground water filter.\n\nCal Silva, Environmental Quality Officer for Dukes County remarked, \u201cThe natural purifying system provided by the aquifer is indispensable for proper environmental balance, not only for this locale, but also for the entire Island. We learned today that the pond was drained by executive order without our consent.

The health and well-being of local shellfish and wildlife may very well be severely compromised due to this,\u201d added Silva.\n\nReaction spread quickly throughout this closely-knit community, made up of year-rounders, summer residents, and day-trippers.

But this thing with the pond has made a lot of people a little uncomfortable now. It\u2019s like they took charge all of a sudden and changed the way things work without first thinking about the Vineyard or asking anybody.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in the town was as upset at the situation as Sanders, though. Several avid golfers from the area say they completely understood losing a ball in that water trap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve golfed at Farm Neck many, many times,\u201d said resident Henry Bellows. \u201cI\u2019ve lost countless balls to that pond.

Now that it\u2019s happened, though, I am tempted to sneak down there with a bucket and pick up some free balls.\u201d\n\nQuality officer Silva expressed optimism that the natural balance could be restored if enough rainfall replenishes the now drained wetland.\n\n\u201cNature has a way of taking care of itself. Already there are a number of birds who are feeding at the marshland that was created by this event, so that\u2019s a benefit in a strange way which we\u2019ve not been able to observe before.

Shanteal Johnson, mother of Jamal, was understandably angry that her son was seated in the very rear of the bus, despite there being many other seats available.\n\n\u201cThis is racism, plain and simple. They put my boy at the back of that bus, and there were all of them other seats available. They can say what they want, and they can spin it however, but this is a direct slap in the face of Rosa Parks, and an assault on African-Americans by the Akron School district,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nIn response to the allegations of racism, Akron Public Schools has released an explanatory, yet scathing statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we do acknowledge that Jamal Johnson was seated at the back of the bus, we contest that the seating arrangements had anything to do with race. Yes, Jamal is African-American. He is also a paraplegic, and our handicapped accessible buses have a wheelchair lift at the rear entrance. The chair is lifted and rolled in through the rear door, where it is secured to the floor with a clamp system. So while he was seated at the back of the bus, the seating was simply due to the mechanical characteristics of the vehicle. Handicapped students of other races and heritages are seated in the same fashion. Any accusation of racism here is idiotic and patently ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe prepared statement was met with derision and incredulity by some Akronites who believe that the ramp story is just a convenient excuse, and Shanteal herself is undecided about whether or not to believe its contents.\n\n\u201cIt all seems contrived to me, like maybe they knew when they designed these buses that there would be black handicapped students riding at the back of them someday. Maybe what they say is true, Lord knows I hope that it is; but for some reason, I feel that everyone is laughing at our expense. I guess I\u2019ll take the statement at face value for now, but if I find out this has all been a big joke at the expense of the African-American people, there will be hell to pay.\u201d\n\nThroughout the awkward situation with its finger-pointing and flaring tempers, perhaps eleven year old Jamal has been the one to keep the coolest head.\n\n\u201cI like sitting at the back of the bus,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the problem.

It is a movement spearheaded by parents who don\u2019t trust medicine, and embrace natural living.

Besides, most of these things we vaccinate against aren\u2019t even around anymore.

They are abusing the program,\u201d said Vilsack. \u201cThis has painted us into a corner, we knew it was going on, we just didn\u2019t realize the dramatic extent of abuse. We feel absolutely defeated. Now the families who need it and deserve it will go without. That is a tragedy. However the money is gone, the White House will not supply us further assistance. If you want to eat, you\u2019ll have to go to work.\u201d\n\nThe announcement has infuriated those who depend on assistance, such as Mary Parker of Washington, D.C., who was nearly brought to tears when asked her opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame our government can\u2019t step up for us and pay for our food. I got five children that depend on it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do now. I guess I\u2019ll actually have to get a job.\u201d\n\nThere are also those who agree with the decision, like Jim Conrad of Jersey City, New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s about time. People like me work their entire lives, pay taxes, and even when we could have used help, we never asked for help, we learned how to take care of our own, on our own. You got people illegally moving into the country, working under the table, taking over the construction trade, they get paid cash and they get food stamps? It has to stop. It is about damn time we stop letting people, especially foreign and lazy people, abuse the system. Make them fend for themselves!\u201d\n\nPresident Obama, who worked with the Department of Agriculture in shutting down the program, said that the time has come for Americans to make their own way, and that the current system was obviously too broken to repair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how we can help families in need in the future because of those people who abused the current SNAP program,\u201d said President Obama. \u201cSadly, we can\u2019t do anything further for the actual needy at the moment. We simply asked that people be honest out of American pride, and our people have failed us. It is, to say the least, very disheartening.\u201d\n\nOfficials for the Department of Agriculture had no further comment.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Woman Arrested For Breastfeeding At Wal-Mart": ["https://empirenews.net/woman-arrested-for-breastfeeding-at-wal-mart/", "0\n\nLYNCHBURG, Virginia \u2013\n\nA mother who was breastfeeding her newborn daughter in a Lynchburg Wal-Mart was arrested on Wednesday evening after a store employee called the police for what they said was \u2018lewd behavior.\u2019 Mary Lambert, whose daughter, Kathy, is 5 months old, was shopping in her local Wal-Mart store when her baby began \u2018fussing,\u2019 and needed to be fed.\n\n\u201cI knew as soon as she started squirming that it was dinnertime,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cI was in a relatively secluded part of the back of the store, near the Lawn & Garden section, and I began to feed Kathy. She only needed a minute or two, then she was done, and I went along my way. I didn\u2019t even know anyone had seen me.\u201d\n\nAccording to police reports, no one had seen her, at least not from within the aisles. A security guard, Aaron Silver, was monitoring the activities throughout the store from within the location\u2019s security room, saw Lambert feeding and immediately called the police.\n\n\u201cShe was basically getting naked in public. I could almost seen her nipple for a second.

DeMar bought Jake from a shelter a little over a year ago, and he says that they have been inseparable ever since.\n\n\u201cI love Jake more than I have ever loved anyone in the world,\u201d said DeMar, a retail manager for a large big-box chain. \u201cI\u2019m not homosexual, myself. I\u2019ve never really been attracted to any man or woman that I\u2019ve known. When I adopted Jake, I was lonely. I haven\u2019t been lonely since.\u201d\n\nAccording to the wording of laws in most states where gay marriage has been legalized, a man or woman may marry someone of the same sex, and be granted the same rights and privileges as that of heterosexual couples. The laws in Maine, which voted to legalize same-sex marriages in 2012, are worded slightly differently, allowing DeMar to legally wed his canine pal.\n\n\u201cIn Maine, we made the mistake of saying that any male can marry another male, or female can marry female, and be granted the rights of marriage,\u201d said David Klein, a representative for the Maine State Bar Association. \u201cBecause it does not say man and man, but rather male and male, Mr. DeMar was able to apply for and receive his marriage license at his local town hall.\u201d\n\nNormally, laws would also be worded to include statements about both parties being mentally fit and able to sign the marriage certificate, which is a legally binding document.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case in Maine, either,\u201d said DeMar. \u201cI really looked into a lot before we went through with this. I signed my name, and Jake really did put his paw into some ink and I had him step on the certificate. I think he knows that we\u2019re married. He gave me sloppy kisses right there at the town hall in front of the notary public.\u201d\n\nOfficials for the Maine State Attorney General say that they are working with the local and state government agencies to re-word the law as quickly as possible, before anyone else uses the loophole to wed their pets.\n\n\u201cThis was an oversight on our part that is bringing us disturbing attention,\u201d said Klein. \u201cYou can bet that the laws will be rescinded and changed as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy that I was able to make this happen,\u201d said DeMar. \u201cUnfortunately, Maine state law is extremely strict on the acts of bestiality, so I refuse to elaborate on whether or not we have consummated our relationship.

The program, named \u2018Gas For Guns,\u2019 offers gun owners the opportunity to exchange their weapons, with or without legal documentation, for a $500 gas card.\n\n\u201cA date has not been set but it will more than likely take place in early January, just after the holidays, when American families need a little more assistance with living expenses than normal. The event will last two weeks. It will be a really good avenue to help those in need while at the same time getting dangerous weapons off the streets,\u201d said Earnest.\n\nThe exchange program, part of a master plan by President Obama to get rid of guns in the U.S., will give gun owners the opportunity to go to local police stations, firehouses, and in some cities \u201cmobile exchange units\u201d to bring in their weapons. Volunteer gun experts will be on-hand to appraise the firearms, although the gas cards will be valued at $500 regardless of make, model, style, or appraised value of the firearm. Even guns without proper documentation can be turned in.\n\n\u201cNo questions will be asked, but we ask those that do have legal documentation to please bring it with your firearm. Those that do not will only be asked for their drivers licenses\u2019 or state identification cards, which will then be copied. This process is simply for keeping track of the gift cards that are exchanged. The participant will then be given the $500 gas gift card, regardless of the appraised value, to be used at a local participating gas company. What is important is that we get guns off the streets and help those in need at the same time,\u201d Earnest announced.\n\nGuns which are handed over will be taken to a licensed gun manufacturing facility, which will be paid an undisclosed amount by the government per weapon, and will be disassembled and discarded accordingly under ATF supervision while being fully monitored. Officials have said that many of the weapons, especially those with little to no value or that are in non-working order, will be melted down for their metals.\n\nAs gun control is a very controversial issue, announcement of the program has divided opposition even further. Gun advocate and Washington D.C. native Tom Gillispie told reporters after catching wind of the announcement, \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous, they want just anybody to walk , pull out a gun, then trade it in for a $500 gas card? No matter if the gun is worth $50 or not? So a criminal with bad intentions can bring in a gun worth $100, get a $500 gas card, then trade the gas card for $450 cash then go buy an even more dangerous gun? This is the asinine apocalypse. This is exactly why our country is in a downward spiral. We will go further into debt and the bad guys will still have guns in the end, while those needing guns for protection will not. This is absurd. It is times like this I am embarrassed to be an American.\u201d\n\nTourist Mary Carcepizzi, from Trenton, New Jersey had quite a different take on the matter. \u201cI think it is an excellent idea. That $500 may save a life in the future, and I am absolutely positive that will be the case for several of the guns turned in. They will be destroyed, as all guns should be, and for each one destroyed, that is one less unnecessary weapon we will have to worry about falling into the wrong hands.

The web site states \u201cIf \u2018We The People\u2019 want real change, we are going to have to do something radical, like nominate Jesse Ventura for President in 2016.\u2019\n\nDespite having a massive amount of support from wrestling, political, and media fans, there are some people who think he is too brash and far out to make a good President.\n\nIn late July, Ventura won a lawsuit against slain Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle\u2019s widow, Taya Kyle. The suit stated that before Kyle\u2019s death, he had fabricated a story about punching the former Governor for comments he made when the two happened to be in the same bar on an evening in 2006. Ventura claimed that the entire altercation never happened, and walked away from court with an undisclosed settlement from the now deceased sniper\u2019s estate.\n\nIn the wake of this controversy, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin spoke out against Ventura publicly on Twitter. Ventura tweeted out a series of retalitatory responses related to Palin\u2019s comments, which he later deleted but did not issue an apologize for.\n\n\u201cDo you think I care at all about what @SarahPalinUSA has to say?

Ventura had recently launched his show \u201cOff the Grid\u201d on the Ora TV Network, which he was in the middle of promoting on his twitter account, likely prompting him to delete the tweets about Palin.\n\nJesse Ventura has been outspoken about his distaste for the rich running the country and the greed in Washington being the primary element bringing down our country. He continues to flirt with the idea of running for President, but political experts have been doubtful.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the movie Idiocracy,\u201d stated John Greer, Professor of Public Policy and Education at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe only thing Jesse is going to put a choke hold on is legitimate third-party candidates vying for their parties\u2019 nomination.

If I don\u2019t hit my goal, then I\u2019m going to shoot this cat, film it, and post it online. Then everyone who saw this post, or heard about it, and didn\u2019t donate any money, can know they had a hand it murdering an animal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kickstarter, they are keeping the page up while they work with members of the FBI to track down the individual who posted the page. At this time, they are not sure if the page is a legitimate threat towards the animal, or if it is someone trying to capitalize on the fact that no one wants to see an innocent animal harmed, and may be willing to fork over their own money to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s all a joke, and he\u2019d never hurt the animal.

Because of a hefty new \u201cBee Tax,\u201d landlines may soon be making a comeback. This new environmental \u201cprotection tax\u201d will be approximately $25 dollars per line added to your current monthly cell phone bill. It is expected to make its appearance on all U.S. cell phone carriers, after the 911 Surcharge and Federal Excise Tax, by 2015.\n\nSince the introduction of cellphones, the bee population has been on a well-documented decline. While humans can not perceive cell phone signals, communication between mobile phones and cell towers confuses bees, causing them to become disoriented. Unable to function normally, colonies of honey bees are steadily collapsing. Since honey-bees are crucial in pollination, this presents a huge problem. For some time now the USDA has denied any correlation between cell phones and bee colony collapse, but it has reached a point where farmers are seeing an impact nationwide.\n\n\u201cIt has become clear that cell-phone use needs to be limited.\u201d Said Peter Mayer, a representative for the USDA. \u201cCell phone rates will go up, but we need to encourage more landline usage.

Maine is the first state in the country to adopt such a law, although several other New England states have been researching the idea for several years, including Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.\n\nMaine governor Paul LePage (R), said that the new law would be a \u201chuge leap forward\u201d for the safety of the people of Maine.\n\n\u201cBefore this law, we had no regulations on helmets at all. Motorcycles could whip down the highway at 70 MPH, and the driver was not legally required to wear any protection.\u201d Said LePage. \u201cThis completely disregarded the fact that we had a seatbelt law for all occupants of regular cars and trucks. Why would we have one law, and not the other? It\u2019s asinine. So we really went full-on with this new regulation.\u201d\n\nPrevious law said that anyone, whether passenger or driver of a vehicle, must wear a seatbelt. This new law would also require them to wear a helmet, either bicycle-style or those designed for motorcycles \u2013 basically just something to protect the head in a crash.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re riding a Harley or driving a Honda, you are going to be required to put on a helmet.\u201d Said LePage.\n\nOpponents of the new law have not easily been silenced, including the Maine chapter of the Wheels of Satan , a notorious motorcycle club with several charters across the country. Members of the group are furious, personally blaming LePage for taking away their freedom to ride without a helmet, something they say they hold dear to their hearts.\n\n\u201cI hate helmets, and I came to Maine to avoid the strict helmet laws of other states.\u201d Said Brent \u201cHefty\u201d Capabianco, president of the Wheels of Satan\u2019s Portland, Maine charter. \u201cNot only are they forcing us to wear a helmet while riding, now I also have to wear a helmet when I get in my Godd\u2014 truck, too? This state is out if its mind. The Wheels are not happy, and we\u2019re going to be making that fact known.\u201d\n\nThe law, which was voted on yesterday, will take effect September 1st. At that point, police will be able to levy fines on any motorist not wearing DOT approved head protection. The fines begin at $75, the same as Maine\u2019s seatbelt fines.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "New Law Will Make Practicing The Mormon Religion Illegal": ["https://empirenews.net/new-law-will-make-practicing-the-mormon-religion-illegal/", "0\n\nPROVO, Utah \u2013\n\nReligion has always been a touchy subject any way one chooses to look at it, causing wars, hatred, and feuds that may or may not have happened if it wasn\u2019t for the beliefs held by any number of people. Regardless of the issues it may cause, one thing in life is certain, and that is that you are free to choose to believe in whatever you want, and the government cannot stop you.\n\nApparently, things are about to change for those wishing to practice at least one major religion. A new law being voted on in congress could pass, effectively making it illegal to follow the Mormon religion.\n\nIt is unclear why the United States would be voting to outlaw any religion, especially Mormonism, but the penalties and guidelines it entails are very extreme: anyone seen practicing the Mormon religion would be held in a prison cell for up to but not to exceed 5 years, and will only be released once a therapist and appointed clergyman feels that their beliefs have changed. This would still be true even if the law was repealed while the accused was incarcerated.\n\nIn conjunction with backlash that will come with such a harsh law, the government has said they will be offering a therapy program to Mormons that would like to learn about becoming followers of another religion, and the program will also give them an outlet to following that new way of life.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, it does kind of make me happy to know I won\u2019t have some stranger knocking on my door at 7:30AM, wanting to talk about God.\u201d said Joe Goldsmith of Provo. \u201cI\u2019ve never been less interested in anyone\u2019s beliefs \u2013 except for of course, perhaps, the Jehovah Witnesses.

Meth has been around for years, but became extremely popular after the Showtime TV series Breaking Bad hit the air. While producers only cared about the show brining in huge ratings, everyone ignored the fact that it was also brining in thousands and thousands of new users to the drug.

Fearing that their child may be the next victim of sexual abuse, many parents are crying out and asking what they can do to prevent these things from happening to their own kids.\n\nEmpire spoke to a recently-released child killer, who we will refer to as \u201cJared\u201d, about what parents can do to ensure that their children are not even on a criminal\u2019s radar.\n\n\u201cYou already know how to educate your kids on stranger danger.\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of the time, telling your kids not to talk to a stranger isn\u2019t going to stop a potential pedophile from snatching them. Put it this way, if a criminal sees something he desires, ain\u2019t nothing going to stop him if its what he really wants.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve gotta do, is stop dressing your children so godd\u2014 trendy.

Last year, London, England played host to the first ever Global Kids Fashion Week, where young children skipped down the catwalk in designer gear. Even more recently, Florence, Italy held the first annual Pitti Bimbo, a childrenswear trade show. Gone are the days where kids were simply dressed in t-shirts and jeans.

Stylishly dressed kids these days are becoming more and more a fashion accessory, and less like the children of a bygone era.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a criminal sees a stylishly dressed child, he sees an object, not a person, he sees a fashion accesory begging to be used.\u201d Jared\u2019s horrifying words almost mirroring Mrs Okes. \u201cHe sees sex incarnate, the same as most men would in any model walking down the runway.\u201d\n\nWhether or not how a child dresses is a factor into the dispicable crimes we unfortunately see so often, is debatable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous!\u201d Said Jeanne Curtis, mother of two young girls. \u201cThe idea that how my kids are dressed has anything to do with whether they will be abducted or not is just disgusting.

The bill has the support of the NRA and has been praised by many gun-rights advocates as a common-sense step towards decreasing gun violence.\n\nThe bill would introduce a procedure whereby any American seeking to become mentally ill would have to announce their intentions to local law enforcement. From the time of their decision, citizens would then have to wait a full 72 hours before actually becoming mentally ill, giving law enforcement and local support systems plenty of time to prepare to deal with the issue.\n\nRepresentative Wilson says this bill could help prevent most, if not all, of the gun violence which has plagued our nation for years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while now that America has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem.\u201d Said Wilson. \u201cWell, it\u2019s time we start taking concrete steps to help fix this.\u201d\n\nLater in the press conference, Wilson elaborated on the reasoning behind the bill, saying that people need to better understand the impact that becoming mentally ill can have on their lives.\n\n\u201cThis waiting period might not be the perfect solution, but I think forcing people to sit and really think about whether or not they want to become mentally ill could help a lot of folks.\u201d Said Wilson.\n\nNRA President Wayne LaPierre has thrown the full weight of the NRA behind the bill already.

Although not a direct quote, onlookers reported hearing West screaming at himself in the mirror, swearing and saying \u201cwatch where you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nEver the prima donna, West then called his stylist demanding that he be fit for new clothes as his current outfit, supposedly one of a kind, was being worn by someone else. Kanye only became more infuriated when he noticed the figure was mimicking his movements.\n\nWhen informed that it was Kanye\u2019s reflection in the mirror, and then someone patiently explaining what a reflection was, he protested that it was impossible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m way better looking than this fool!\u201d West screamed, causing a wave of laughter by onlookers.\n\nAfter coming to terms with the fact that he could not fire his own reflection, he flew back to America and filed a lawsuit. Kanye is suing his reflection both for the assault that occurred in the meeting, and misrepresenting him for 37 years. His lawyers reluctantly filed the suit, despite hours of trying to explain why the case would make him look horribly stupid. Kanye rebuffed their attempts, and now West and his reflection are set to appear in court September 31st.\n\nIn the meantime, West has filed a restraining order against his reflection, which has already been violated several times in the past few days. Police were called to Kanye\u2019s home the morning after the suit was filed, as Kanye\u2019s duplicate was accused of commiting a home invasion. West claimed he was startled by the very man he was at odds with while getting dressed in front of a full-length mirror.\n\nOfficers who arrived were led to the room where the incident occurred, but they found nothing. West entered the room moments later only to act alarmed, screaming that the intruder was behind them. The police had to stifle their laughter and told West that they\u2019d \u201cget their best men on that matter.\u201d\n\nIn spite of his current ordeal, West is still very hard at work in the studio and tweeted to his fans that \u201cThere may be a thousand of him, but there\u2019s only one of me.\u201d\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Bill Clinton Hits Talk Show Circuit to Promote New Book of White House Themed Erotica": ["https://empirenews.net/bill-clinton-hits-talk-show-circuit-to-promote-new-book-of-white-house-themed-erotica/", "0\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton hit the talk show circuit this week to promote his new book, a collection of White House themed erotica. Clinton\u2019s book tour actually parallels wife Hilary\u2019s, as she continues promoting her own book, Hard Choices, a grounded, autobiographical look at her time as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.\n\nThe former president took to the airways to promote his book, simply titled Hard, which follows the exploits of a main character named \u201cPresident Stiff Poundstone,\u201d who takes part in an increasingly bizarre series of sexual encounters in-between presidential events.\n\nFormer President Clinton has remained cagey on the question of whether President Poundstone is entirely fictional, though he has hinted that parts of the story are based on his own time in the White House. In an interview with Robin Roberts on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Clinton explained that \u201cIn chapter 6, where President Poundstone makes sweet love to the sexy brunette head of the Federal Reserve in exchange for taking $360 billion off of the federal debt? Well, that\u2019s partly true, I really did reduce the federal debt by that much.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some have speculated that former President Clinton wants Hard to, in part, be his way of rewriting the history of his Presidency. Those who subscribe to this belief point to the books tenth chapter, where the media accuse President Poundstone of having sex with an intern. In Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency, such an accusation lead to an eventual impeachment trial. In Clinton\u2019s new book, however, President Poundstone simply admits to the affair and, to quote the text, \u201c\u2026 Everyone agreed that it was an awesome thing to do, and all the media high-fived the President as they shotgunned Pabst Blue Ribbon beer together.\u201d\n\nHard\u2019s extremely adult subject matter and coarse language meant that Clinton was precluded from reading any large sections of it during his appearances. Instead, the former President was forced to merely summarize parts of the book, hoping to entice readers with his descriptions.\n\nOn \u201cCBS Sunday Morning,\u201d Clinton told Charles Osgood that \u201cIn chapter three, President Poundstone has to entertain the hot blonde twin Polish ambassadors in order to prevent ruining a state dinner. Things get really steamy when a lobster escapes from a pot of boiling water and joins the fun. It\u2019s one of my favorite chapters- hell I\u2019m getting a chubby just thinking about it.\u201d\n\nMost of Mr. Clinton\u2019s public appearances promoting the book have been solo, but he was accompanied by Hilary during a segment on Morning Joe with Joe Scarborough. During the interview, Mr. Clinton was engaged and egarly answered all of Scarborough\u2019s questions, while Hilary kept her head buried in her hands, only occasionally looking up to stare angrily at her husband and ask \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just have my own thing just this one time?\u201d\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Michigan Woman Arrested For \u2018Eating Too Provocatively\u2019": ["https://empirenews.net/michigan-woman-arrested-for-eating-too-provocatively/", "0\n\nDEARBORN, Michigan \u2013\n\nLovingly referred to as \u201cLittle Lebanon\u201d by many of its residents due to the city\u2019s highly concentrated Lebanese population, Dearborn, Michigan was home to a rather bizarre arrest this past Saturday when Katherine Murphy, a Dearborn native of Irish descent, was grabbing a shawarma (a wrap filled with meat and vegetables) for lunch with her coworker at a popular local establishment. Two police officers approached her, claiming complaints had been made by several passerby about the way she was eating and the clothes she wore.\n\n\u201cI was just minding my business, eating my lunch, and all of the sudden I was being treated like a criminal, of the worst kind! A perverted criminal!\u201d Said Katherine, who says she was wearing slacks and a button down blouse at the time of her arrest. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. I mean \u2013 how can this be right? I have to find a lawyer, and go through a whole process. For what? For not covering my hair?\u201d\n\nIn a bizarre situation like this, one can see how prevalent the Arab influence is in the city, especially in East Dearborn, where many of the local shops have signs written in both English and Arabic. With most businesses catering to the Arab population, it becomes more clear why Murphy stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe officers arrested Murphy, citing complaints they claimed to have received about \u2018a woman who was eating a shawarma in a provocative manner while exposing herself to the public.\u2019 Murphy, who was rightfully outraged, was very vocal in her opposition of what she says was a \u2018pathetic abuse of power.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll of the women around me were wearing hijabs, but I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not Muslim. I respect that their culture, but I don\u2019t think I should have partake to just because I want to eat lunch. And not wearing one certainly doesn\u2019t mean I was exposing myself!\u201d\n\nModesty is a virtue valued in the Muslim community. Many women choose to cover their bodies, baring minimal to no skin, sometimes showing only the eyes, feet and hands. They rarely expose more than this to anyone beyond close relatives, to prevent a man they may marry from seeing what they look like. A hijab is a traditional scarf women wear to cover their hair, and sometimes face.\n\nAbdullah Mouawad, Murphy\u2019s coworker, takes her side on this issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was eating provocatively on purpose, Katherine\u2019s just a very attractive woman and she can\u2019t help that a shawarma is so phallic in nature.\u201d says Mouawad. \u201cPolice corruption of power is out of control in this city. They told her that her hair should be covered and there were plenty of places where she could buy a hijab to do so. I feel really bad because we had never been to that restaurant and it was my suggestion. I don\u2019t even know how to help her now.\u201d\n\nMurphy was arrested and charged with Misdemeanor Indecent Exposure and was release on $2,000 bail while she awaits trial.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, but I\u2019m still really nervous.

According to police reports, the couple had physically hit each other several times, and had thrown pieces of furniture and empty liquor bottles across the room. Their young child was in the room the entire time.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I may have been having some problems that upset my son, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the actions that Officer Deville, or Officer Devil as we call him, took with my son,\u201d Said Goldsmith. \u201cHe should be ashamed of himself for berating a small child, and treating him like a criminal.

Kids are a real pain in the ass sometimes, ya know?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome kids, they just need a stern hand,\u201d Said Deville when questioned about the incident. \u201cObviously his parents couldn\u2019t handle him, so yeah, I put him in my cruiser. I didn\u2019t use the zipties on him or anything for crying out loud. I just used regular old fashioned handcuffs, and the kid slipped out of them in about two seconds because he has tiny toddler wrists. That\u2019s the reason I ended up bringing him to my car. Incidentally, he stopped crying while he was out there. Probably because he didn\u2019t have to look at his mom\u2019s bitch face anymore.\u201d\n\nBoth parents were arrested for domestic battery that evening, and their son spent the night with his grandmother.\n\nRepresentatives at the Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the union that represents Deville, had no comment on the case.

A recent survey by ABC News found that over 40% of young adults (ages 16-25) admit to abstract expressionist painting while driving, with 20% saying they create a mind-bending work of pure exploration every single time they get behind the wheel.\n\nPhiladelphia Police Chief Charles Ramsey was instrumental in creating this new initiative. He says he first became passionate about this issue after a series of accidents in his home city.\n\n\u201cThese young people, most of them teenagers, had gotten in to wrecks because they were distracted, applying paint to canvass in non-representational ways and trying to push the limits of what paint can express when they should be keeping their eyes on the road.\u201d Said Ramsey. \u201cI hope this program will help keep more people focused, and remind drivers that they can always explore two-dimensional reality after they get wherever they\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nEmpire News spoke to one teenager, Louis, who says that he started abstract expressionist painting while driving almost as soon as he got his license. Says Louis, \u201cIt\u2019s not as big a deal as some people make it out to be. If you know what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll be fine.

Any police officer who catches him paining while driving is within their rights to arrest him. In most jurisdictions, abstract expressionist painting while driving carries a penalty of up to $500, and one scathing review of the painting in question by a magazine or newspaper of record.\n\nSome outside of law enforcement have alleged that the crackdown on abstract expressionist painting while driving is unfairly targeted at young people. Studies have shown that those above the age of 40 tend to avoid abstract expressionism, but that 43% of them landscape or portrait paint while driving, and 37% of them compose classical epic poetry while behind the wheel.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"], "Texas Judge Sentences Man To Death For Marijuana Possession": ["https://empirenews.net/texas-judge-sentences-man-to-death-for-marijuana-possession/", "0\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2013\n\nAn Austin Superior Court judge sentenced 34 year old Joseph Goldsmith to death row yesterday, after Goldsmith was picked up on his third offense for marijuana possession.\n\nJudge Martin Churchill said during the trial that he had \u201calready seen [Goldsmith] twice\u201d and that \u201cthe third time was the charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a man cannot get his act together, and he is arrested multiple times for the same crime, then I have no choice but to hand out the swiftest and harshest punishment I can.\u201d Said Churchill. \u201cIn this case, the public needs to know how the state of Texas deals with repeat offenders, especially when they are drug-related crimes.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith, who has no other arrests on his report other than the previous two convictions for misdemeanor marijuana possession, was visibly upset when the verdict was read.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe it.

I had actually considered letting 10 people go, but the Taliban, they started with 5 and I decided there was no reason to counter that number. Now that I have learned what I have about Bergdahl, I would have no problems trading him back. I\u2019ll even take just 3 people back in exchange.\u201d Said Obama.\n\nBergdahl will return his hometown of Hailey, Idaho within the next few weeks, although not to the fanfare that was originally scheduled. Plans for a parade in his honor, as well as entire hometown celebration, were abandoned after news of his deserter status began to spread across the internet. Originally planned for July 28th, the town\u2019s official word is that they don\u2019t have the resources to contain the amount of people expected. It is quite possible, though, that the backlash from the internet, as well as threats, hatred, and menace aimed at the town for planning a celebration had something to do with their cancellation.\n\n\u201cThe City of Hailey believes in due process, and we are very happy to let the process unfold,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cIn the meantime, our celebration will focus on [Bowe\u2019s] release and the relief of his family and those who live here.\u201d\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments"]}
